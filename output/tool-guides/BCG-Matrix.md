# The BCG Growth-Share Matrix

## What This Tool Does

The **BCG Growth-Share Matrix** classifies a company's business units or product lines into four categories based on two variables: **market growth rate** and **relative market share**. Developed by the Boston Consulting Group in the early 1970s, this tool helps executives answer the most fundamental portfolio question: where should we invest, and where should we pull back? It transforms a sprawling collection of business units into a disciplined investment framework.

## When to Use It

Use the BCG Matrix during the strategy formulation stage when a multi-business corporation needs to allocate resources across its portfolio of business units or product lines. It is most useful when the organization has multiple business units competing in different markets at different growth rates. The matrix is typically applied after completing external analysis (EFE) and competitive positioning work, so that market growth and competitive position data are already in hand.

## Before You Start

- Identify all business units or major product lines in the portfolio
- Gather market growth rate data for each unit's industry (industry reports, analyst data)
- Calculate or estimate each unit's relative market share (unit's market share divided by the largest competitor's market share)
- Have revenue and profitability data available for each unit
- Understand the corporate strategy context: Is the company pursuing growth, stability, or retrenchment?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Define the Business Units

List every distinct business unit, division, or product line that operates in a separate market. Each unit should have its own competitive dynamics and its own identifiable revenue stream. Avoid lumping together businesses that serve fundamentally different markets just because they sit under the same division name.

### Step 2: Determine Market Growth Rate for Each Unit

For each business unit, identify the annual growth rate of the industry or market in which it competes. Use a consistent timeframe, typically the most recent three to five years of data or a forward-looking projection. The conventional dividing line is 10 percent: markets growing above 10 percent are considered high-growth, and those below 10 percent are considered low-growth. Adjust this threshold based on the macroeconomic context and the specific industry norms. This value determines vertical placement on the matrix.

### Step 3: Calculate Relative Market Share for Each Unit

Divide each unit's market share by the market share of its largest competitor. A value greater than 1.0 means the unit leads its market; a value less than 1.0 means it trails the leader. For example, if your unit holds 20 percent market share and the largest competitor holds 40 percent, your relative market share is 0.5. The conventional dividing line is 1.0. This value determines horizontal placement on the matrix. Note that the horizontal axis is typically displayed in reverse, with high relative market share on the left.

### Step 4: Plot Each Unit on the Matrix

Place each business unit on a two-by-two grid. The vertical axis represents market growth rate (high at top, low at bottom). The horizontal axis represents relative market share (high at left, low at right). Each unit falls into one of four quadrants: **Star**s (upper left), **Question Mark**s (upper right), **Cash Cow**s (lower left), or **Dog**s (lower right). Size the circles proportionally to each unit's revenue contribution to make the visual more informative.

### Step 5: Classify and Interpret Each Quadrant

Assign each unit its quadrant label and review the strategic implications:

- **Stars** occupy high-growth markets where the unit holds a leading position. They generate strong revenue but also consume significant cash to maintain growth. The strategic priority is continued investment to defend market leadership.

- **Question Marks** (also called Problem Children) sit in high-growth markets but hold a weak competitive position. They consume cash and may or may not develop into Stars. The strategic choice is binary: invest heavily to build market share, or divest before the unit drains resources without return.

- **Cash Cows** hold dominant positions in low-growth markets. They generate more cash than they need because the market demands less reinvestment. Profits from Cash Cows should fund Stars and selected Question Marks. The strategic priority is to harvest cash while maintaining the competitive position.

- **Dogs** hold weak positions in low-growth markets. They typically produce little profit and tie up capital and management attention. The default strategic recommendation is divestiture, liquidation, or managed decline, though there are circumstances, discussed below, where retaining a Dog serves a broader purpose.

### Step 6: Develop Portfolio-Level Strategy

Step back and evaluate the portfolio as a whole. A healthy portfolio has a balanced mix: Cash Cows funding Stars and promising Question Marks, with Dogs either divested or on a path to exit. An unhealthy portfolio has too many Question Marks draining cash, no Cash Cows to fund growth, or too many Dogs tying up resources. Identify the specific investment, divestiture, and harvest decisions implied by the current positioning, and draft resource allocation recommendations.

## Scoring Guide

**Table 1**
*BCG Matrix Quadrant Classification Criteria*

| Quadrant | Market Growth Rate | Relative Market Share | Cash Flow Profile |
|---|---|---|---|
| Star | High (above 10%) | High (above 1.0) | Roughly neutral; high generation offset by high reinvestment needs |
| Question Mark | High (above 10%) | Low (below 1.0) | Negative; heavy cash consumption with uncertain returns |
| Cash Cow | Low (below 10%) | High (above 1.0) | Strongly positive; high generation with low reinvestment needs |
| Dog | Low (below 10%) | Low (below 1.0) | Roughly neutral to slightly negative; low generation, low investment |

## Interpreting Your Results

A completed BCG Matrix tells you where to deploy capital and where to stop spending. Read the portfolio, not just individual quadrants.

If your portfolio is dominated by Stars, you likely have strong growth but may face cash flow pressure. Ensure you have enough Cash Cows or external financing to sustain the investment those Stars require.

If your portfolio is dominated by Cash Cows, you have strong current cash flow but face a long-term growth problem. The company risks stagnation unless Cash Cow profits are funneled into Stars or high-potential Question Marks.

If your portfolio is dominated by Question Marks, you have a decision crisis. Each one demands a binary choice: invest aggressively or exit. Trying to maintain all of them at mediocre funding levels is the worst possible outcome, because none will reach the scale needed to become Stars.

If your portfolio is dominated by Dogs, the company faces serious strategic distress. Resources are locked in units with no growth prospect and no market leadership. The priority is divestiture and reallocation toward higher-potential businesses.

The most dangerous portfolio is one that looks balanced on the surface but lacks a clear investment thesis. Every unit should have an explicit strategic role: grow, harvest, or exit. Ambiguity kills resource allocation discipline.

## Real-World Example

Consider Procter & Gamble's product portfolio in the early 2000s, before its major portfolio restructuring under CEO A.G. Lafley (Lafley & Martin, 2013) and later David (David, 2017) Taylor. P&G operated in categories spanning beauty, grooming, health care, fabric and home care, and baby and family care, with over 170 brands.

**Table 2**
*Illustrative BCG Classification of Select P&G Business Units (Early 2000s)*

| Business Unit | Market Growth | Relative Market Share | BCG Quadrant |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tide (Laundry) | Low (~3%) | High (market leader) | Cash Cow |
| Gillette (Grooming) | Moderate (~5%) | High (dominant share) | Cash Cow |
| SK-II (Premium Beauty, Asia) | High (~15%) | Moderate (growing) | Question Mark |
| Iams (Pet Food) | Moderate (~6%) | Low (trailing leaders) | Dog |
| Pampers (Diapers) | Low (~2%) | High (market leader) | Cash Cow |

P&G used this type of analysis to rationalize its portfolio. Between 2014 and 2017, the company divested or discontinued roughly 100 brands, including several "Dog" and underperforming "Question Mark" categories. Proceeds and management focus were redirected toward the core categories where P&G held market leadership. The result was a leaner portfolio of approximately 65 brands that generated 95 percent of the company's profits. Cash Cows like Tide and Pampers continued funding investment in growth segments, while underperforming units no longer drained resources.

The lesson is straightforward: the BCG Matrix does not make the decision for you, but it clarifies which decisions you are avoiding.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Using Absolute Market Share Instead of Relative Market Share**
Students frequently plot market share as a raw percentage rather than dividing by the leading competitor's share. A business with 25 percent market share looks strong in absolute terms, but if the leader holds 50 percent, the relative share is only 0.5, placing the unit on the weak side of the axis. Always divide by the largest competitor's share to get the correct positioning.

**Mistake 2: Treating Quadrant Prescriptions as Automatic**
The matrix suggests general strategic directions, not commands. Selling every Dog and funding every Star without judgment leads to outcomes that ignore context. A Dog might serve as a loss leader that drives traffic to a Cash Cow. A Star might be in a market about to face regulatory disruption. Use the matrix as input to strategic thinking, not as a substitute for it.

**Mistake 3: Ignoring the Time Dimension**
The BCG Matrix is a snapshot. Markets decelerate, and Stars become Cash Cows. Competitors gain share, and Cash Cows become Dogs. A single matrix tells you where units sit today, not where they are heading. Update the analysis regularly and track movement across quadrants over time.

**Mistake 4: Failing to Account for Interdependencies Between Units**
Business units do not operate in isolation. Divesting a Dog that shares a distribution network with a Cash Cow can damage the Cash Cow's cost structure. The matrix does not capture synergies, shared resources, or cross-selling relationships. Before acting on a divestiture recommendation, map the interdependencies.

**Mistake 5: Setting the Growth Rate Threshold Arbitrarily**
The 10 percent dividing line is a convention, not a law. In a low-growth economy, 5 percent growth may represent a high-growth market. In a technology sector, 10 percent may be below average. Calibrate the threshold to the company's industry and economic environment, and document the rationale for the threshold chosen.

## A Note on Stewardship

**Portfolio management** is stewardship in its most tangible form. When you plot business units on the BCG Matrix, you are deciding how to allocate resources that affect not just shareholders but communities, employees, and customers whose livelihoods depend on those decisions. Luke 12:48 (NIV) puts it plainly: "From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded." A corporation with a diversified portfolio has been given much, and the allocation choices it makes carry proportional weight. Funding a Star while divesting a Dog is not inherently wrong, but the executive who makes that decision bears responsibility for understanding the full consequences. A Dog business unit that employs 200 people in a community with no other major employer is not just a quadrant classification. It is a stewardship question that pure financial analysis cannot answer. The matrix gives you clarity. Your values, and your willingness to account for what you have been given, determine what you do with it.

## Knowledge Check

### Multiple Choice

**Question 1 [Bloom's: Analyze]**

A diversified consumer goods company has four major divisions. Division A holds 35% market share in a market growing at 3% per year, where the next largest competitor holds 20%. Division B holds 12% market share in a market growing at 18% per year, where the market leader holds 30%. Division C holds 40% market share in a market growing at 14% per year, where the next largest competitor holds 25%. Division D holds 8% market share in a market growing at 2% per year, where the market leader holds 35%. Which division is classified as a Question Mark?

A) Division A, because it operates in a low-growth market despite strong share
B) Division B, because it has low relative market share in a high-growth market
C) Division C, because it has high relative market share in a high-growth market
D) Division D, because it has low relative share in a low-growth market

*Correct Answer: B*
*Rationale: Division B has a relative market share of 0.4 (12%/30%) in a market growing at 18%, placing it in the Question Mark quadrant (low relative share, high growth). Division A is a Cash Cow (relative share 1.75, low growth). Division C is a Star (relative share 1.6, high growth). Division D is a Dog (relative share 0.23, low growth).*

---

**Question 2 [Bloom's: Analyze]**

A technology conglomerate discovers that its portfolio contains five Cash Cows, one Star, and no Question Marks. What is the most significant strategic risk this portfolio composition reveals?

A) The company is generating too much cash and should increase dividends immediately
B) The company lacks investments in high-growth markets and faces long-term stagnation
C) The Cash Cows will inevitably become Stars if the company invests enough capital
D) The company should convert its Cash Cows into Question Marks by entering new markets with those same units

*Correct Answer: B*
*Rationale: A portfolio dominated by Cash Cows with no Question Marks signals that the company is not investing in future growth opportunities. Cash Cows sit in mature, low-growth markets. Without Question Marks or additional Stars in high-growth markets, the company's revenue base will stagnate as those mature markets eventually decline. Option A treats a symptom rather than the strategic problem. Option C misunderstands the framework: Cash Cows cannot become Stars because their markets are low-growth by definition. Option D conflates the business unit with the market it serves.*

---

**Question 3 [Bloom's: Analyze]**

An executive proposes divesting a Dog business unit that generates $5 million in annual profit. The Dog shares a manufacturing facility and distribution network with the company's largest Cash Cow, which generates $80 million in annual profit. Eliminating the Dog would increase the Cash Cow's per-unit costs by approximately 15%. What does this scenario reveal about the limitations of the BCG Matrix?

A) The matrix correctly identifies the Dog as a divestiture candidate, and the cost impact on the Cash Cow is an acceptable trade-off
B) The matrix does not account for interdependencies between business units, making the divestiture recommendation potentially harmful to overall portfolio performance
C) The matrix should be replaced with a financial model whenever business units share resources
D) The executive should reclassify the Dog as a Cash Cow because it contributes to the profitability of another unit

*Correct Answer: B*
*Rationale: The BCG Matrix evaluates each business unit independently based on market growth and relative share. It does not capture operational synergies, shared infrastructure, or cross-subsidization effects. Divesting the Dog in this scenario could damage the Cash Cow's profitability far more than the Dog's own contribution would suggest. Option A ignores the $12 million cost impact on the Cash Cow (15% of $80M). Option C goes too far; the matrix is still useful as one input among several. Option D misapplies the classification criteria, which are based on market position, not internal cost contributions.*

### Critical Thinking

A regional hospital system operates four service lines: cardiac care (high growth, market leader), orthopedics (low growth, market leader), pediatric specialty care (high growth, small market share serving an underserved rural population), and a general family medicine clinic (low growth, small share relative to larger competitors in the area). The BCG Matrix would classify pediatric specialty care as a Question Mark and the family medicine clinic as a Dog.

**Question:** The CFO recommends divesting both the pediatric specialty care line and the family medicine clinic to concentrate resources on cardiac care and orthopedics. As a Christian healthcare executive, how do you evaluate this recommendation? In your response, address the strategic logic of the BCG analysis, the limitations of applying portfolio theory to healthcare, and how stewardship principles should inform the final decision. Consider which stakeholders are affected and what obligations, if any, extend beyond financial performance.

**Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Excellent (9-10) | Demonstrates nuanced understanding of both the strategic rationale and its limitations in a healthcare context. Engages multiple stakeholder perspectives including patients, employees, and the underserved community. Applies stewardship and vocational purpose principles without proof-texting. Recognizes the tension between fiduciary responsibility and mission-driven care. Proposes a thoughtful path forward rather than a simple accept-or-reject answer. Well-organized with clear reasoning. |
| Proficient (7-8) | Addresses both strategic and ethical dimensions. Applies BCG concepts correctly and identifies key limitations. Shows integration of faith principles with business reasoning. Identifies major stakeholder impacts. Clear reasoning with minor gaps in analysis. |
| Developing (5-6) | Addresses the question but overemphasizes either the financial case or the ethical case without integrating both. Limited application of BCG concepts or superficial faith integration. Some logical gaps or missing stakeholder perspectives. |
| Needs Work (3-4) | Misses key dimensions of the problem. Minimal application of strategic frameworks. No meaningful faith integration or forced references. Unclear reasoning or overly simplistic answer. |
| Insufficient (0-2) | Off-topic, demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of the BCG Matrix or the ethical dimensions, or fails to engage the scenario meaningfully. |

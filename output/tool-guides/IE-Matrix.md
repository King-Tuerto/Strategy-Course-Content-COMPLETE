# The Internal-External Matrix

## What This Tool Does

The **Internal-External (IE) Matrix** plots a firm's divisions or business units on a **nine-cell grid** based on two scores already calculated: the IFE total weighted score (horizontal axis) and the EFE total weighted score (vertical axis). Each cell maps to one of three strategic prescriptions — grow and build, hold and maintain, or harvest and divest. The IE Matrix takes the work you have already done in the IFE and EFE and converts it into a strategic direction for each business unit. For a multi-division firm, it provides a portfolio-level view that shows which divisions deserve investment and which should be managed for cash or exited.

## When to Use It

Use the IE Matrix during the matching stage of strategy formulation (David & David, 2017), after you have completed both the IFE Matrix and the EFE Matrix for each division or business unit being analyzed. The IE Matrix depends entirely on those two inputs — without completed IFE and EFE scores, you cannot plot anything. It is typically used alongside the SWOT Matrix and Grand Strategy Matrix as a matching tool that translates analytical scores into strategic direction. For diversified firms with multiple divisions, the IE Matrix functions similarly to the BCG Matrix but uses a richer data foundation (weighted factor scores rather than just market growth and market share).

## Before You Start

- Complete an IFE Matrix for each division or business unit, producing a total weighted score between 1.0 and 4.0
- Complete an EFE Matrix for each division or business unit, producing a total weighted score between 1.0 and 4.0
- Know the revenue or profit contribution of each division (used to size the circles on the matrix for visual weighting)
- Understand that the IE Matrix evaluates each division separately — a diversified company will have multiple plots on the same grid
- If the firm operates as a single business unit, the IE Matrix still applies, but it plots one point rather than a portfolio

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Gather IFE and EFE Scores

Collect the total weighted score from each division's IFE Matrix and EFE Matrix. These are your plotting coordinates. A division with an IFE score of 3.10 and an EFE score of 2.45 will be plotted at those coordinates on the grid. Ensure the scores are final — any revision to the underlying IFE or EFE factors, weights, or ratings will change the division's position on the IE Matrix.

### Step 2: Set Up the Nine-Cell Grid

Draw a grid with the IFE total weighted score on the horizontal axis and the EFE total weighted score on the vertical axis. Both axes range from 1.0 to 4.0.

The horizontal axis (IFE) is divided into three regions:
- **Strong** (3.0 to 4.0) — left columns
- **Average** (2.0 to 2.99) — middle columns
- **Weak** (1.0 to 1.99) — right columns

The vertical axis (EFE) is divided into three regions:
- **High** (3.0 to 4.0) — top rows
- **Medium** (2.0 to 2.99) — middle rows
- **Low** (1.0 to 1.99) — bottom rows

This creates nine cells. The cells are conventionally numbered I through IX, with Cell I in the upper left and Cell IX in the lower right.

### Step 3: Plot Each Division

Place each division on the grid at the intersection of its IFE and EFE scores. Represent each division as a circle, with the circle's size proportional to the division's revenue contribution (or profit contribution, depending on the analytical focus). This proportional sizing allows the viewer to see at a glance which divisions carry the most financial weight and where they fall strategically.

### Step 4: Identify the Strategic Prescription for Each Division

The nine cells map to three strategic regions:

- **Grow and Build** (Cells I, II, IV): Divisions in these cells have strong-to-average internal positions combined with high-to-medium external positions. They warrant aggressive investment — market penetration, market development, product development, and integration strategies are appropriate.

- **Hold and Maintain** (Cells III, V, VII): Divisions in these cells occupy the middle ground. They are neither strong enough to justify aggressive investment nor weak enough to warrant exit. Market penetration and product development are the most common strategies — protect current position without committing to major expansion or accepting decline.

- **Harvest or Divest** (Cells VI, VIII, IX): Divisions in these cells have weak internal positions, weak external positions, or both. They are candidates for retrenchment, divestiture, or liquidation. These divisions consume resources that could be redeployed to divisions in the Grow and Build region.

### Step 5: Evaluate Portfolio Balance

Step back and assess the **portfolio balance** as a whole. A healthy portfolio has the majority of revenue concentrated in the Grow and Build or Hold and Maintain regions, with minimal revenue trapped in the Harvest or Divest region. An unhealthy portfolio shows significant revenue in Cells VI, VIII, or IX — capital and management attention locked into divisions that the analysis says should be shrinking or exiting.

Compare the IE Matrix portfolio view to the BCG Matrix (Hitt et al., 2020). The two tools should tell a broadly consistent story. If they contradict each other for a specific division, investigate the discrepancy — it usually points to an assumption in one analysis that needs reexamination.

### Step 6: Develop Division-Level Strategic Recommendations

For each division, translate the **strategic region** into specific actionable recommendations. A division in Cell I (strong IFE, high EFE) with a large revenue circle warrants the most aggressive investment. A division in Cell IX (weak IFE, low EFE) with a small revenue circle is the most straightforward divestiture candidate. The harder decisions involve divisions in the Hold and Maintain region — these require judgment about whether the division is trending toward Grow and Build or sliding toward Harvest and Divest, which the static matrix alone cannot answer.

## Scoring Guide

**Table 1**
*IE Matrix Cell Assignments and Strategic Prescriptions*

| Cell | IFE Score Range | EFE Score Range | Strategic Region | Prescription |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | Strong (3.0-4.0) | High (3.0-4.0) | Grow and Build | Aggressive investment, integration, intensive strategies |
| II | Average (2.0-2.99) | High (3.0-4.0) | Grow and Build | Invest to strengthen internal position while external conditions are favorable |
| III | Weak (1.0-1.99) | High (3.0-4.0) | Hold and Maintain | External environment is favorable but internal weakness limits growth potential |
| IV | Strong (3.0-4.0) | Medium (2.0-2.99) | Grow and Build | Strong internal position justifies continued investment despite moderate external conditions |
| V | Average (2.0-2.99) | Medium (2.0-2.99) | Hold and Maintain | Protect position with market penetration and product development |
| VI | Weak (1.0-1.99) | Medium (2.0-2.99) | Harvest or Divest | Weak internal position in a moderate environment — consider retrenchment or exit |
| VII | Strong (3.0-4.0) | Low (1.0-1.99) | Hold and Maintain | Strong internally but facing an unfavorable external environment — defend and monitor |
| VIII | Average (2.0-2.99) | Low (1.0-1.99) | Harvest or Divest | Average capabilities in a hostile environment — limited upside justifies harvesting |
| IX | Weak (1.0-1.99) | Low (1.0-1.99) | Harvest or Divest | Weak position in hostile environment — divest or liquidate |

## Interpreting Your Results

**Grow and Build (Cells I, II, IV)**

Divisions in this region have earned the right to receive investment. Their internal capabilities are at least average (and often strong), and their external environment presents sufficient opportunity to justify the expenditure. But "grow and build" is not a blank check. The specific strategy should match the division's position within the region.

Cell I divisions — strong internally with a favorable external environment — are the prime candidates for the most aggressive strategies: forward integration, backward integration, horizontal integration, market penetration, market development, and product development. These divisions should receive priority in capital allocation.

Cell II divisions have a favorable external environment but only average internal capabilities. Investment should focus on strengthening the internal weaknesses that prevent the division from moving into Cell I. The external opportunity will not last forever — the division needs to build capability while the environment is supportive.

Cell IV divisions are strong internally but face only moderate external conditions. They should continue investing to maintain competitive advantages but should not overextend into aggressive expansion that the external environment may not reward.

**Hold and Maintain (Cells III, V, VII)**

Divisions in this region occupy strategic middle ground. They are not failing, but they are not positioned for aggressive growth either. The appropriate strategies are defensive: market penetration to protect share, product development to stay relevant, and selective investment that maintains competitive position without overcommitting resources.

The key question for Hold and Maintain divisions is trajectory. Is the division trending upward (improving IFE or EFE scores) or downward? A Cell V division that has been improving steadily may be approaching Grow and Build territory and deserves continued support. A Cell V division with declining scores may be sliding toward Harvest and Divest and should be managed more conservatively.

Cell III represents an unusual and instructive case: the external environment is highly favorable, but the division's internal position is weak. This creates a strategic question similar to Quadrant II of the Grand Strategy Matrix — should the firm invest heavily to fix internal weaknesses before the external window closes, or accept that the division cannot compete effectively and exit while conditions are still favorable enough to attract a buyer?

**Harvest or Divest (Cells VI, VIII, IX)**

Divisions in this region are consuming resources that the analysis suggests should be redeployed elsewhere. The strategic prescription is to extract maximum cash from these divisions while reducing investment, or to sell or close them.

Cell IX is the most straightforward: weak internally, facing a hostile external environment. Unless there are compelling strategic interdependencies with other divisions, divestiture or liquidation is the recommended path.

Cell VI and Cell VIII require more nuanced judgment. A Cell VI division (weak internally, moderate external environment) might be salvageable if the internal weaknesses are addressable and the cost of fixing them is justified by the moderate opportunity. A Cell VIII division (average internally, hostile external environment) might be worth holding temporarily if the external conditions are expected to improve.

The hardest decisions in the IE Matrix involve divisions that generate significant revenue but fall in the Harvest or Divest region. Selling a division that contributes 20 percent of corporate revenue takes courage. But continuing to invest in a division that the data says is competitively weak in an unfavorable environment takes more courage — and produces worse outcomes.

## Real-World Example

Consider General Electric (General Electric, 2016) in the mid-2010s, before its major restructuring under CEO John Flannery and later Larry Culp. GE operated across multiple divisions with dramatically different competitive positions and external environments.

**Table 2**
*Illustrative IE Matrix Scores for Select GE Divisions (Mid-2010s)*

| Division | IFE Score | EFE Score | IE Cell | Strategic Region | Revenue Share (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GE Aviation | 3.45 | 3.20 | I | Grow and Build | 25% |
| GE Healthcare | 3.10 | 2.85 | IV | Grow and Build | 18% |
| GE Power | 2.30 | 1.75 | VIII | Harvest or Divest | 27% |
| GE Capital | 2.10 | 2.00 | V | Hold and Maintain | 20% |
| GE Transportation | 2.50 | 2.10 | V | Hold and Maintain | 5% |
| GE Lighting | 1.60 | 1.45 | IX | Harvest or Divest | 2% |

The IE Matrix revealed a portfolio under severe strain. GE's two strongest divisions — Aviation (Cell I) and Healthcare (Cell IV) — were generating strong performance but together accounted for only 43 percent of revenue. Meanwhile, GE Power — the single largest revenue contributor at 27 percent — sat in Cell VIII (Harvest or Divest), reflecting weak external conditions in the global power generation market and an average internal position that had been deteriorating as gas turbine demand declined.

GE Lighting in Cell IX was the clearest divestiture candidate: weak internally, facing a hostile environment as the lighting industry commoditized. GE Capital and GE Transportation in Cell V warranted hold-and-maintain strategies — defensible but not growth engines.

The strategic implication was stark. The division that contributed the most revenue (Power) was the one the IE Matrix said should be harvested or divested. The divisions that warranted aggressive investment (Aviation and Healthcare) were not large enough on their own to replace Power's revenue contribution. This is the kind of uncomfortable truth the IE Matrix is designed to surface — and the kind of truth that organizations frequently resist acting on until the situation becomes a crisis.

GE's subsequent history confirmed the analysis. The company eventually restructured around Aviation, Healthcare, and Energy (a successor to Power), divesting or spinning off most other operations. The IE Matrix, had it been taken seriously in the mid-2010s, would have pointed to this outcome years earlier.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Using Stale IFE and EFE Scores**
The IE Matrix is only as good as the scores feeding it. If the IFE and EFE Matrices were completed six months ago and have not been updated, the IE Matrix reflects a past reality that may no longer hold. Both input matrices should be current before plotting.

**Mistake 2: Plotting the Entire Corporation as a Single Point**
A diversified firm with multiple divisions operating in different industries cannot be meaningfully represented by a single IFE and EFE score. Each division faces different external conditions and has different internal capabilities. Plotting each division separately is the entire point of the tool for multi-business corporations.

**Mistake 3: Treating the Boundaries Between Regions as Precise**
A division with an IFE score of 2.95 and an EFE score of 2.95 sits in Cell V (Hold and Maintain), just barely missing Cell I (Grow and Build). The 0.05 difference in scores does not represent a meaningful strategic distinction. Divisions near the boundaries between regions should be evaluated with strategies from both adjacent regions in mind. The lines on the grid are conventions, not cliffs.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Circle Size in Portfolio Analysis**
The **proportional circles** represent revenue (or profit) contribution and carry critical strategic information. A small circle in Cell IX is a straightforward divestiture. A large circle in Cell IX is a strategic emergency. The size of the circle determines the urgency and difficulty of the strategic action, not just the direction.

**Mistake 5: Failing to Compare the IE Matrix with the BCG Matrix**
The IE Matrix and BCG Matrix should produce broadly consistent portfolio assessments. A division that appears as a Star in the BCG Matrix should generally fall in the Grow and Build region of the IE Matrix. If a division is a Cash Cow on the BCG but sits in Harvest or Divest on the IE Matrix, something is wrong with one of the analyses — possibly the IFE or EFE data, possibly the BCG assumptions about market share and growth. Use the discrepancy as a diagnostic signal, not as a reason to pick whichever answer is more comfortable.

## A Note on Faithful Stewardship of Resources

The IE Matrix confronts leaders with a specific kind of stewardship decision: how to allocate finite resources across divisions that compete for attention, capital, and talent. The matrix makes the case analytically — some divisions warrant investment, others warrant harvesting, and some should be exited. But acting on those conclusions requires more than analytical skill. It requires the willingness to follow the evidence even when it leads to difficult decisions. Paul's letter to the Corinthians captures the standard plainly: "Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful" (1 Corinthians 4:2, NIV). Faithfulness in organizational stewardship means directing resources where they can produce the greatest good and withdrawing them from where they cannot — not because the decision is easy, but because the trust demands it. A leader who continues to fund a Cell IX division out of sentimentality or political convenience is not being kind. That leader is misallocating resources that could be strengthening a Cell I division or investing in the organization's future. The IE Matrix does not make this decision painless. But it clarifies the choice and removes the excuse of ignorance. Once you know where your divisions stand, what you do with that knowledge becomes a question of character.

## Knowledge Check

### Multiple Choice

**Question 1 [Bloom's: Analyze]**

A diversified corporation has four divisions. Division A has an IFE score of 3.30 and an EFE score of 3.50. Division B has an IFE score of 2.40 and an EFE score of 2.60. Division C has an IFE score of 1.70 and an EFE score of 1.50. Division D has an IFE score of 1.85 and an EFE score of 3.15. Division B contributes 45% of total corporate revenue. What is the most significant strategic concern this portfolio reveals?

A) Division C should be divested immediately because it falls in Cell IX
B) Division A deserves all available capital because it falls in Cell I
C) The largest revenue-generating division (B) sits in the Hold and Maintain region, meaning the firm's primary profit engine is not positioned for growth and the portfolio lacks a dominant Grow and Build contributor at scale
D) Division D should be reclassified as Grow and Build because its EFE score is above 3.0

*Correct Answer: C*
*Rationale: Division B (IFE 2.40, EFE 2.60) falls in Cell V (Hold and Maintain) and generates 45% of revenue. This means nearly half the company's revenue comes from a division that the IE Matrix says should be defended but not aggressively grown. Division A is in Cell I (Grow and Build) but its revenue share is not specified and may be insufficient to drive corporate growth on its own. The most significant strategic concern is the mismatch between where the revenue is concentrated and where the growth potential lies. Option A is a reasonable action but not the most significant concern for the portfolio overall. Option B ignores the need for balanced capital allocation. Option D misapplies the framework — Division D (IFE 1.85, EFE 3.15) falls in Cell III (Hold and Maintain) because its weak internal position limits growth potential despite the favorable external environment.*

---

**Question 2 [Bloom's: Analyze]**

A company's IE Matrix shows Division X plotted in Cell II (IFE 2.45, EFE 3.30) and its BCG Matrix classifies the same division as a Question Mark. Are these two assessments consistent, and what do they collectively suggest?

A) The assessments are inconsistent because Cell II is Grow and Build while Question Marks are high-risk
B) The assessments are consistent — both indicate a division operating in a favorable, high-growth environment but holding only an average or below-leading competitive position, and both suggest the firm must decide whether to invest heavily to strengthen the division or accept the risk of it failing to capture the opportunity
C) The BCG Matrix should take precedence because it uses more objective data
D) The IE Matrix should take precedence because it incorporates more factors than the BCG Matrix

*Correct Answer: B*
*Rationale: Cell II of the IE Matrix (average internal strength, high external opportunity) aligns with the BCG Question Mark quadrant (high-growth market, low relative market share). Both tools identify the same strategic reality: the environment is favorable, but the division's competitive position is not strong enough to guarantee it will capture the opportunity. Both imply the same binary decision — invest aggressively to build strength, or accept that the division may not succeed. The assessments reinforce each other. Option A misreads the Grow and Build prescription as conflicting with risk — Cell II's Grow and Build recommendation specifically means investing to strengthen a division that is not yet strong. Options C and D create a false hierarchy; the tools complement each other.*

---

**Question 3 [Bloom's: Analyze]**

A firm plots three divisions on the IE Matrix. Division 1 falls in Cell IV (IFE 3.20, EFE 2.30) and contributes 15% of revenue. Division 2 falls in Cell V (IFE 2.50, EFE 2.50) and contributes 50% of revenue. Division 3 falls in Cell VIII (IFE 2.20, EFE 1.60) and contributes 35% of revenue. The CEO proposes allocating capital equally across all three divisions. What does the IE Matrix suggest about this allocation decision?

A) Equal allocation is appropriate because it treats all divisions fairly and avoids the risk of over-investing in any single unit
B) The IE Matrix indicates that Division 1 should receive the most investment (Grow and Build), Division 2 should receive moderate investment (Hold and Maintain), and Division 3 should receive reduced investment or be considered for divestiture (Harvest or Divest) — equal allocation ignores the strategic differentiation the matrix is designed to provide
C) Division 2 should receive the most capital because it generates the most revenue
D) Division 3 should receive the most capital because it needs the most improvement

*Correct Answer: B*
*Rationale: The IE Matrix exists to differentiate divisions by strategic prescription. Division 1 in Cell IV (Grow and Build) warrants the most aggressive investment. Division 2 in Cell V (Hold and Maintain) warrants defensive investment to protect its position. Division 3 in Cell VIII (Harvest or Divest) should receive reduced investment — yet it contributes 35% of revenue, making it a large-circle Harvest division that demands difficult action. Allocating capital equally defeats the purpose of the analysis by treating strategically different situations identically. Option A mistakes equal allocation for sound portfolio management. Option C uses revenue size as the allocation criterion rather than strategic position. Option D follows the logic of investing most where the need is greatest, which is precisely the trap the IE Matrix is designed to prevent — pouring resources into weak positions rather than strong ones.*

### Critical Thinking

A nonprofit healthcare network operates three divisions: a flagship urban hospital (IFE 3.40, EFE 2.85, Cell IV — Grow and Build), a network of rural clinics serving underserved communities (IFE 1.75, EFE 1.70, Cell IX — Harvest or Divest), and a research institute partnered with a local university (IFE 2.60, EFE 3.10, Cell II — Grow and Build). The rural clinics operate at a persistent financial loss but serve as the only healthcare access point for three counties with a combined population of 40,000 people. The IE Matrix clearly indicates that the rural clinics should be harvested or divested.

**Question:** Evaluate the IE Matrix's recommendation to harvest or divest the rural clinic network. Is the tool providing a valid strategic signal, or does it fail to capture dimensions of value that are essential to a nonprofit healthcare mission? In your response, address what the IE Matrix does and does not measure, whether financial sustainability is a prerequisite for mission fulfillment or a constraint that mission can sometimes override, and what alternative strategic approaches might allow the organization to address the clinics' weak IE position without abandoning the communities they serve. Consider how a leader weighs analytical tools against organizational purpose when they point in different directions.

**Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Excellent (9-10) | Demonstrates nuanced understanding that the IE Matrix measures competitive and environmental positioning but does not capture mission value, community impact, or moral obligation. Recognizes the tool's recommendation as valid on its own terms while identifying its limitations for a nonprofit context. Engages the tension between financial sustainability and mission fulfillment without treating them as simply incompatible. Proposes creative strategic alternatives (partnerships, grant funding, restructuring, cross-subsidization) that address the weak IE position without abandoning service. Addresses the leadership challenge of tool-versus-purpose conflict. Well-organized with clear reasoning. |
| Proficient (7-8) | Addresses the tension between IE Matrix recommendations and nonprofit mission. Correctly identifies what the tool measures and what it misses. Proposes at least one alternative to divestiture. Recognizes that financial viability and mission are both legitimate considerations. Clear reasoning with minor gaps. |
| Developing (5-6) | Addresses the question but oversimplifies — either accepts the IE Matrix recommendation without engaging mission concerns, or dismisses the tool entirely without acknowledging the financial reality. Limited engagement with alternative strategic approaches. Some logical gaps. |
| Needs Work (3-4) | Misses the core tension between analytical recommendation and organizational mission. Minimal application of IE Matrix concepts. Does not propose alternatives. Unclear reasoning. |
| Insufficient (0-2) | Off-topic, demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of the IE Matrix, or fails to engage the scenario meaningfully. |
